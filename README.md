# iOS_StopWatch
## Description
This is a simple iOS app that combines both a timer and a stopwatch functionality. Users can switch between the timer and stopwatch modes using a segmented control. 
The timer mode allows users to set a specific time duration using a UIPickerView, and the stopwatch mode functions as a traditional stopwatch.
## Features
- **Timer Mode:** Users can set a specific time duration using a UIPickerView.
- **Stopwatch Mode:** Traditional stopwatch functionality with start, pause, and reset buttons.
- **Play, Pause, Stop Buttons:** In both timer and stopwatch modes, there are buttons to control the timer or stopwatch.
- **Dynamic Icons:** The icons of the play, pause, and stop buttons change when touched to reflect their current state.
